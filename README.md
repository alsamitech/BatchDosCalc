# BatchDosCalc
DosCalc Ported to Batch, Should run on MS-DOS and Windows

Mirrror of the Batch implementation of DosCalc, a simple console calculator that me and another person (he whishes to stay anyonomous) worked on. 

Keep in mind that this is just a mirror of the .bat file, While this is an official mirror of DosCalc(Batch implementation, I lost the documentation for it, and I'm not willing to write more documentation
