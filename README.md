# BatchDosCalc
DosCalc Ported to Batch, Should run on MS-DOS and Windows

Mirrror of the Batch implementation of DosCalc, a simple console calculator that me and a few other people (Other Members of the Doscalc association) worked on. 

Keep in mind that this is just a mirror of the .bat file, While this is an official mirror of DosCalc(Batch implementation), I lost the documentation for it, and I'm not willing to write more documentation
